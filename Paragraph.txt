ü©∫ Simple Cancer Test Form (HTML Only)

This project is a basic cancer self-check form created using only HTML.
‚ö†Ô∏è It is not a real medical tool ‚Äî it is just a practice project for learning HTML forms.

Users can:

Fill in basic personal details (name, age, gender).

Answer some yes/no questions related to general health symptoms.

Submit the form (though no data is stored, since it‚Äôs pure HTML).


The goal of this project is to practice form inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and form structure in HTML, while also presenting it in a clear, human-friendly way.
